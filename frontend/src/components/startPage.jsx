                Blockchain Technology is used in the web app for secured
                transaction of ethers. As soon as someone scans the barcode of
                the product he/she buys, according to its eco-friendly rating
                and price of the product, a cashback will be generated to the
                person's account in terms of ether. We also try to initiate a
                cleanliness drive into people by providing an reward cum
                incentive in terms of ether according to a mathematical function
                which generates the amount of ether to be transferred into the
                person's account according to the value of waste the person
                dumps.
